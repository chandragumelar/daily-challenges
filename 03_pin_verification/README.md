# Challenge 03: PIN Verification System

This challenge practices `while` loops and nested `if` logic to simulate a simple PIN entry system.

### Flowchart

### Objective
- Ask the user to enter a 4-digit PIN (correct PIN: `2468`)
- Allow **3 attempts**
- If the user types `"forgot"`, show a help message and exit
- If the correct PIN is entered, show `"Access granted."` and exit
- After 3 wrong attempts, show `"Account locked."`

### Code
See `main.py` for the logic.
