### Objective
- Ask the user for their age
- Use the current year (from `datetime.now().year`)
- If input is invalid → show `"Invalid input. Please enter a number."`
- If age is < 0 or > 120 → show `"Unrealistic age. Try again."`
- If valid → print `"You were born in XXXX."`
- Uses `while True`, `try/except`, and clean logic

### Code
See `main.py` for the implementation.
